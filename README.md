## Introduction

The Selection Process would involve 3 phases. The students shortlisted in phase 1 **would be split into buckets according to their skillset or interest (frontend or backend) and then given a task for their specific bucket. This task will not be a basic task like Round 1, we would expect you to show your expertise in your skillset, even aspects like documentation will be considered.**

The third phase would be interviews, the details of which would be shared later.
